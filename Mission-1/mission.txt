The first mission is to set up a GitHub repo, and use Visual studio (free) to create a C# console application that gives me the option of three greetings.

 It has to be committed and pushed to that repo so I can look at it when it's done

mission log:

First time ever using Visual Studio and learning C#.

my screen recordings failed...
Downloaded some free software off microsoft store and didnt notice till I was done with the project that it only records 3 minutes at a time.

But to sum up what I did and how long it took,
took me 2 hours in total start to finish with downloading Visual Studio.

While Visual Studio was downloading I read a small part of the book 'C# programming Yellow Book'. Download for free at csharpcourse.com.

Really only looked at pages 14-17.

Then viewed this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ocHr0ICuGU

just a few minutes of this one after https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGQX97XNF-A

I youtube searched 'C# console that gives greeting'
scrolled a bit and was lucky enough to find this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foH7ZfC-Hk

it's a text adventure game.
I sped my way through it but I knew this video would have exactly what I needed. 

Because from the start I knew I would need to Present the 3 options and then need some sort of action to pick a greeting and then display that greeting, and the Text adventure does exactly that. 

So I borrowed the principles of what he did in the game to make my greeting App.

Next time i'll have full video of the whole thing, found out my Graphics card has the GE Experience thing used for recording games and it works perfectly... 

Watched this video to help me push to GitHub https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRI3OVavUbE
